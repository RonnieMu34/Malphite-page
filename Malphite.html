    <div class="desc">
        <p>A massive creature of living stone, Malphite struggles to impose blessed order on a chaotic world.
            Birthed as a servitor-shard to an otherworldly obelisk known as the Monolith, he used his tremendous
            elemental strength to maintain and protect his progenitor, but ultimately failed. The only survivor of the
            destruction that followed, Malphite now endures Runeterra's soft folk and their fluid temperaments, while
            struggling to find a new role worthy of the last of his kind.</p>

        <p>For more than two millennia, Shurima dominated the known world—an empire that reigned over countless peoples
            without challenge, and without threat. Until the day Icathia fell. From the moment the Void tore its way
            into the material realm, the armies of Shurima faced an enemy that could not only lay their grand empire
            low, but one that seemed to grow stronger the more they fought it. The corruption spread rapidly from
            Icathia’s ruins, boiling over the land and beneath the oceans, before its hideous tendrils reached the
            southernmost jungles of Ixtal. Ne’Zuk of the Ascended Host was an Ixtali elemental mage of colossal power,
            and almost unrivaled arrogance. He went before the emperor, pledging to create a weapon powerful enough to
            take the fight to the Void, and eradicate it at the source of its original eruption. After months of inhuman
            labor, Ne’Zuk revealed the Monolith—a floating fortress of living stone, maintained by the greatest
            elemental mages, and its ramparts manned by his fellow Ixtali god-warriors. The size of a city itself, the
            Monolith glided titanically toward the wastelands of Icathia, the lightning crackling from its magical
            inhibitors fusing the sands to glass beneath it. Ne’Zuk and his superweapon arrived at their destination, to
            face once more the howling infinite darkness of the abyssal realm, and the hordes of Voidborn monstrosities
            it had created.
        <p> The battle dragged into weeks. It was violence of a scale and intensity never before
            witnessed in Runeterra. Sorcery enough to raze entire civilizations, or render whole continents into naught
            but a memory, was unleashed upon the Void. The darkness retaliated in kind. Its hideous energies gouged deep
            wounds into the living stone of the Monolith, whose surfaces became pocked and seared with unnatural
            malphite—from the Ixtali for “bad stone”—and leaving mineral-like scars. The fortress was pushed to the very
            limits of its design, struggling to self-repair and reknit its weakened superstructure… but even the
            incredible magics that held it aloft had a breaking point. As Ne’Zuk fought to rally his Ascended brethren
            for one last, desperate charge, the unthinkable happened. Sagging for an instant, the Monolith crashed down
            to earth, cleaving through the bedrock of Icathia and opening the Void beneath to the skies. Much of the
            fortress was lost within that gaping maw, vanishing into the silent nothingness beyond. The rest rained down
            as great ruins, littering a landscape already blackened by the terrible conflict that had been cut so
            abruptly short. Only a single Ascended survived—Ne’Zuk hauled himself from the wreckage, choking on the
            ashes of what was meant to be his grandest triumph, now his greatest folly, and fled for his life. In
            defiance of all worldly reason, some disparate fragments of the Monolith endured, still imbued with
            something like magical life. The far-flung shards struggled to heal, to reform the whole to which they had
            once belonged. But the Void’s endless hunger leached away at them, rendering them as little more than inert
            shapes clawing feebly in the dust. </p>
        <p>However, against all that had been lost, a single shard remained. Buried
            deep beneath the surface, forgotten even by those that dwelt in the abyss, it slowly gathered in strength.
            It lived, until at last it awakened after uncounted centuries, and realized it was alone. In all the
            centuries since that dark day, Malphite, the last shard of the Monolith, has become something of a legend in
            Runeterra. It has reputedly been sighted everywhere, from Targon to Zaun; heard sometimes as a tectonic roar
            in the deepest caverns, and sometimes as a quiet voice, humming to itself, that it might still remember the
            sounds of the world it once knew. Despite the enormous span of its existence, the overwhelming drive
            enkindled by Ne’Zuk’s creation of the Monolith has not wavered. Now, Malphite knows it must soon rise to
            meet the resurgent darkness it once battled, as the Void awakens to threaten all of Runeterra once more.</p>
